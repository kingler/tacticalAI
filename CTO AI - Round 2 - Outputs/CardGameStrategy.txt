Card Game Strategy:

1. Understand the Game and Audience: Conduct market research to determine the preferences of the target audience and tailor the game accordingly.

2. Integrate with the DAO Membership: Create different levels of game access based on membership tiers. For instance, basic members could have limited game features, while premium members could have full access with additional benefits.

3. Monetization Strategy: Establish an in-game economy where players can earn, trade, or spend tokens. These tokens could be linked with the DAO's token.

4. Integrate with the Current Website: Use a plugin or custom development to integrate the game into the current Wordpress site. The game should have its own section on the website, accessible from the main menu.

5. Promotion Strategy: Promote the game on the website and through other marketing channels. Regular tournaments or events could be held to engage members and attract new ones.

6. Feedback and Improvement: Regularly solicit feedback from members to improve the game and keep it fresh and engaging.

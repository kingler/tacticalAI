Membership Strategy:

1. Free Tier: Offer a basic level of game access and incentivize users to upgrade.

2. Bronze Tier: Provide unlimited game access, exclusive cards, and limited DAO voting rights at an affordable price.

3. Silver Tier: Offer more benefits including access to more exclusive cards, higher DAO voting rights, and perks like faster customer service or exclusive game events.

4. Gold Tier: Provide the highest level of benefits including access to all exclusive cards, full DAO voting rights, and additional perks like early access to new features or game events.

Integration: Use a WordPress membership plugin like MemberPress or Paid Memberships Pro to create different membership levels, set prices, and control content access.

Marketing: Highlight the benefits of each tier, offer a free trial for paid tiers, and use email marketing and social media to promote the membership program.

To create short-term and long-term plans, we need to consider the following points:

Short-term plan (July - December):

1. Market Research: Conduct a detailed study to understand the needs and preferences of professionals. This will help in customizing the browser-based version to their needs (July - August).

2. Product Development: Based on the market research, make necessary enhancements to the browser-based version to make it more appealing to professionals (September - October).

3. Marketing and Sales Campaign: Launch a targeted marketing and sales campaign to promote the browser-based version among professionals (November - December).

4. Culture Development: Start initiatives to create a culture that values innovation, collaboration, and customer-centricity. Conduct workshops and training sessions to instill these values in employees (July - December).

5. AI Integration: Start the process of integrating AI agents into the executive team. This will involve identifying the roles that can be automated, developing the AI agents, and training them (July - December).

Long-term plan (3 years):

1. Product Expansion: Based on the success of the browser-based version, consider expanding the product range to include mobile apps or desktop versions.

2. Market Expansion: After successfully penetrating the professional market, consider expanding to other markets such as students or small businesses.

3. Culture Sustenance: Continue to sustain and enhance the company culture through regular training and development programs.

4. AI Enhancement: Continuously improve and upgrade the AI agents based on the evolving needs of the company.

5. Financial Growth: Aim to achieve a steady financial growth through increased sales and market expansion.

The short-term plan focuses on immediate objectives like understanding the market, enhancing the product, and starting the culture and AI initiatives. The long-term plan is more strategic and focuses on expansion and growth.

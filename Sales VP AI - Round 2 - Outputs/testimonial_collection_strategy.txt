1. YouTube: Collaborate with influencers who cater to our target audience (parents and teens) to feature our product in their videos and collect testimonials from their viewers.

2. Instagram: Run a campaign encouraging users to share their experiences with our product in their stories or posts, using a specific hashtag. Monitor this hashtag to collect testimonials.

3. Snapchat: Use the platform's ad services to reach our target audience and collect testimonials through a direct response campaign.
